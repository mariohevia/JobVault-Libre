# JobVault Libre
A privacy-centred, open-source job application tracker designed for users who want full control over their data. JobVault Libre runs entirely on your own machine and stores all information locally, providing a secure and dependable alternative to cloud-based job-tracker tools.

Job searching often involves keeping track of postings, deadlines, application materials, follow-ups, and outcomes. Many existing tools solve this by storing your information on external servers or requiring an online account (often with subscriptions). JobVault Libre takes a different approach. It offers a native desktop experience with no cloud component, no dependency on web services, and no requirement to share any personal information with third parties.

JobVault Libre aims to provide a structured, efficient, and private environment for managing every part of the job application process. The application allows you to record job details, track the status of each application, manage dates and actions, store notes, and document what you submitted. All data remains on your device and can be searched instantly.

Key objectives of the project:

- Deliver a local-only job tracker that preserves user privacy
- Provide a straightforward, native desktop interface
- Maintain an open-source codebase that users can audit and extend
- Avoid cloud storage, online accounts, and telemetry
- Support future integration with optional browser extensions for collecting job information directly from websites
- Remain lightweight and suitable for users who prefer offline software

JobVault Libre is intended for job seekers who value privacy, users who prefer offline desktop applications, and anyone who wishes to maintain their job-search information in a secure and transparent way.
